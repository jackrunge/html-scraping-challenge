* This repository holds two jupyter notebooks that scrape a website for information on mars and analyzes said data to determine facts about mars. <br>
* All the files here were completed for the module 11 challenge for the DU Data Analytics Bootcamp. <br>
* All of the data used was provided by edX and is located in the resources folder, and I adapted the code and markdown notes provided by edX.
